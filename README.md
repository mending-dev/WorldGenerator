/mv create void_world normal -g VoidWorldGenerator
```

### Example with **Worlds**

```bash
/world create void_world NORMAL NORMAL VoidWorldGenerator
```

### ... or use it manually in your **bukkit.yml**

```yaml
worlds:
  world:
    generator: VoidWorldGenerator
```

This will create a completely empty world using the provided **VoidWorldGenerator**.
